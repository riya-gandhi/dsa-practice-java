everything in js happens in a execution context
JS is a synchronous and single threaded language

global execution context is always at the bottom of the call stack

call stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts

--------EC creation takes place in 2 steps
1. creation of memory component also known as the variable component
memory is assigned to all the variables with undefined stored initially: hoisting??
functions called in that code are stored as is completely during memory allocation

2. second step is the code execution
code is executed line by line

-- when a function is invoked
a new local EC is created for that function and added on top of the call stack
program execution goes to the invoked function
in the local EC, again 2 phases are carried out

1. memory allocation to all variables and functions
2. code execution phases

when return keyword is encountered in the function, the local EC is removed from call stack
shifting the program control to the function below it, which actually invoked it with the returned value
