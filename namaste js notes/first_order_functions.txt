the ability of js functions to be passed as value as argument to another function
is known as first class functions

in javascript: functions are first class citizens

// function statement
function z(){

}

// function expression
var a = function xyz(){
    ....this is a NAMED func exp
}
a() will work
xyz() will throw reference error

// anonymous function is a function without name: used for function expression but will throw an error
// if used as a function statement

// remember the diff between function expression and function statement is hoisting
// temporal dead zone for function expression
