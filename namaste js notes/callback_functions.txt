--everything on the call stack is called to be on MAIN THREAD
--callback functions are called when are supposed to without blocking the main THREAD

setTimeout(function xyz(){
 console.log("from xyz callback")
},5000)

console.log("1");
console.log("2");

output will be 
1
2
from xyz callback

call stack is empty till settimeout timer is running
after the timer expires, the callback function is pushed onto the callstack and executed

-- async functions should be used whenever they could as they donot block the main THREAD
