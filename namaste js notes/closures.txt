a function with reference to its lexical scope is known as closure

js can return functions : i suspect smart pointers are used under the hood

function z(){
    let a=3;
    function y(){
        let b=4;
        function x(){
            console.log(a);
            console.log(b);
        }
        x();
    }
    y();
}
z();

js can return functions - its lexical scope is also returned: also called closure
