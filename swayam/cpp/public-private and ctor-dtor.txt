public data members vs private data members
public data members can corrupt the state of a data structure

a mix of public and private data members and functions: strong design principle

----------

constructor is used for *implicit* initialization of object as soon as memory is allocated
using a different member function can be missed by developer hence constructor used

ctor can be parameterised or not parameterised
default ctor is called as soon as memory is allocated
ctor can be OVERLOADED
----if we donot provide a default ctor, FREE DEFAULT CTOR is provided by cpp compiler
hence it is always advised to always provide a default ctor

DTOR cannot be OVERLOADED
dtor called in reverse order of calling of ctor

------------------ object execution lifecycle

memory allocated
ctor called for obj1
ctor called for obj2
code execution
dtor called for obj2 - memory deallocated
dtor called for obj1 - memory deallocated

-------------------------------------------------diff between new and malloc
malloc just allocates memory
new allocates memory and calls the default ctor
